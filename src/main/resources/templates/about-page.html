    <br/>
    <p><b> The Adaptive Quiz </b> activity enables a teacher to create tests that efficiently measure the
        takers' abilities. Adaptive tests are comprised of questions selected from the question bank that are
        tagged with a score of their difficulty. The questions are chosen to match the estimated ability level
        of the current test taker. If the test taker succeeds on a question, a more challenging question is
        presented next. If the test taker answers a question incorrectly, a less challenging question is
        presented next. This technique will develop into a sequence of questions converging on the test taker's
        effective ability level. The test stops when the test taker's ability is determined to the required
        accuracy.</p>
    <p>The Adaptive Quiz activity uses the <a href="http://www.rasch.org/rmt/rmt22g.htm"> "Practical Adaptive
        Testing CAT Algorithm" by B.D. Wright </a> published in Rasch Measurement Transactions(1988), and
        discussed in John Linacre's <a href="http://www.rasch.org/memo69.pdf">"Computer-Adaptive Testing: A
            Methodology Whose Time Has Come" </a>. </p>
